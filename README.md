# Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm on Python and C++.

A sample graph was loaded, execute the Python script or C++ binary file pointing the filename of the graph.

The semantics for the graph is simple, it's just a list of paths between nodes:

"node label"-"cost"-"node label"

Example:

A-10-B
A-7-C
C-9-B
...
